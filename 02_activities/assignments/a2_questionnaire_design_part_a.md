# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

### Describe the purpose of your survey:

The purpose of this survey is to study the relationship between a person's age and their taste in music, specifically in the context of popular music. By understanding how music preferences change with age and across generations, this study aims to contribute to the academic discussion on the sociology of music and age-related cultural shifts.


### Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

<b><i>Target Population</b></i>: Adults within Canada across various age groups, capturing individuals from adolescence through older adulthood to represent different generational perspectives on music‚Äã

<b><i>Sampling Frame</b></i>: I can start with University of Toronto's student and alumni database, supplementing it with outreach to the general Canadian population via online platforms to ensure broader age diversity. This frame will help me access both younger and older individuals, providing a solid basis for intergenerational comparison.

<b><i>Sampling Units</b></i>:  Individual participants, representing a range of age groups, who can provide insights into their music tastes and their perceptions of popular music over a specified period of time‚Äã.

<b><i>Observational Units</b></i>: My observational units are individual survey participants from different age groups who provide me with data on their music preference and perception of popular music. Each participant will be a unique instance for observation, allowing me to study age-related trends and variables within each age group and between age groups.

<b><i>Sampling Strategy</b></i>: I will use a stratified random sampling approach, dividing participants into age-based strata (e.g., teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, etc.). This will ensure that each age group is proportionally represented. I will further draw a random sample from each stratum, which will let me draw comparisons within and between age groups. This stratification will also let me gather a wide range of perspectives across age groups, minimize sampling error, and improve the accuracy of population-level estimates‚Äã.
