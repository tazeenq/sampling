# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of my sample is dependent on my sampling frame, strategy, and coverage. I think that using stratified random sampling ensures proportional representation of different age groups, minimizing bias and improving the accuracy of population-level estimates. However, the sampling frame relies partly on the University of Toronto's student and alumni database, which can lead to coverage errors because it may over-represent younger population and under-represent older population. Supplementing the database with online outreach to general population can address this issue to some extent. However, self-selection bias from online participants might still impact the representation of the sample.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    I am pasting the original survey and revised changes here instead of providing a link for submission.

 	REVISED SURVEY:
    1. How old are you?
	(Same options)

	2. How would you describe your overall music taste? (Select up to 3. Please select the top genres you listen to most often.)
	(Add instructions to limit selection to 3 options to reduce measurement error.)

	(No change.)
	
	9. In your opinion, how much influence does age have on a person‚Äôs music taste?
	(No change.)
	
	10. Do you have any additional thoughts on how age impacts music preferences? (This question is optional.)
	(Clarify that this is optional to reduce respondent burden‚Äã.)
	
3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
	No, the purpose of the survey cannot be fulfilled through an observational study. Observational studies are useful for analyzing existing data or behaviors but they don't have the ability to capture subjective opinions and personal reflections, such as music preferences or the perceived influence of age on these preferences‚Äã. The survey specifically aims to gather self-reported data on individual experiences and perceptions, which are not observable in existing records or datasets‚Äã‚Äã.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
