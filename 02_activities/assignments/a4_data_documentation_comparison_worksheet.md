|| Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33) | Canadian Election Study Online Survey, 2019 | Trophic niche flexibility in Glossophaga soricina: how nectar seeker sneaks an insect snack |
|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type|The GSS GVP employs a stratified random sampling method, ensuring representation across various demographic groups within the Canadian population.|Two-wave panel survey, with a rolling cross-section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave.|Convenience sampling (captive bats in a controlled environment and wild bats captured using mist nets).|
| Sample size|The survey utilized a field sample of approximately 50,000 units. Of these, 40,000 households were invited to participate via an electronic questionnaire, and 24,000 completed questionnaires were expected. The sample sizes at the provincial and stratum levels were determined to ensure acceptable sampling variability for specific estimates, balancing precision at both national and stratum levels.|Campaign Period Survey: 37,822 respondents and Post-Election Survey: 10,340 respondents.|112 Glossophaga soricina were captured, of which 38 fecal samples were analyzed.|
| Target population|The survey targets individuals aged 15 and older residing in Canada's ten provinces, excluding full-time residents of institutions.|Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.|Glossophaga soricina, a Neotropical bat species, primarily known for nectar feeding but also for insect consumptionâ€‹.|
| Sampling frame|The sampling frame combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. This approach aims to enhance coverage of households with telephone access.|Stratified by region, with targets balanced on gender and age within each region. Regions include Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies, and British Columbia. Quotas applied for language balance within regions.|Captive bats housed at the University of Bristol and wild bats captured in the Area de ConservaciÃ³n de Guanacaste, Costa Ricaâ€‹.|
| Survey mode(s)|The survey was conducted using a mixed-mode approach, including electronic questionnaires (e-questionnaires) sent to 40,000 households and follow-up through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) for selected participants who did not respond electronically. This combination aimed to maximize response rates and coverage.|Online survey conducted via the Qualtrics platform.|	Combination of laboratory experiments, infrared video recording, sound recordings, and genetic analysis of fecal samplesâ€‹.|
| Timeline|The GSS GVP is conducted every five years, with data collection for the 2018 cycle occurring from September to December 2018.|Campaign Period Survey: September 13 to October 21, 2019 and Post-Election Survey: October 24 to November 11, 2019.|7-week field survey from late May to early July 2009â€‹.|
| Response rate|The overall response rate for the 2018 cycle was 41.9%.|The post-election survey aimed for a 50% recontact rate from the campaign period, but the documentation states this target was not met. Elsewhere, after cleaning the responses, documentation states that '33,905 Campaign Period Survey and 9544 Post-Election Survey responses remain'. This generally translates into the Post-Election Survey response rate being higher than 92.3% (although it is not reliable).|Not applicable; data collection depended on fecal pellet production during the holding period, which was variableâ€‹.|
| Weights| Survey weights are applied to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection and to ensure that the survey results are representative of the target population.|Raked weights created using province, gender, age group, and education level data from the 2016 Canadian census. Specific weight variables are provided for both campaign and post-election datasets.|Not reported.|
| Data processing|Collected data undergo rigorous processing, including validation, editing, and coding, to ensure accuracy and consistency.|Removal of duplicate responses and low-quality responses (e.g., inattentive respondents, speeders, straightliners, and quota breaches). Identification and resolution of duplicates through demographic and panel matchingâ€‹.|Included DNA extraction and analysis, video synchronization for behavior classification, and echolocation acoustic modelingâ€‹.|
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.|Data cleaning procedures are implemented to address inconsistencies and errors. Imputation methods may be used to handle missing responses, ensuring the completeness of the dataset.|Removal of incomplete responses and speeders. Matching of post-election responses to campaign period responses based on panel IDs and limited demographics.|DNA sequences were aligned and edited; sequences were compared against reference databases for identification.|
| Sources of error|Potential sources of error include sampling error, non-sampling error (such as measurement and processing errors), and non-response bias.|Sampling limitations in underrepresented regions (e.g., territories), self-selection bias in online panel recruitment, and quota fulfillment challenges.|Potential bias due to incomplete reference databases for DNA identification; acoustic measurements might underestimate wild echolocation intensities.|
| Limitations, known biases|The exclusion of certain populations (e.g., residents of institutions) and reliance on telephone interviews may introduce biases. Additionally, self-reported data can be subject to social desirability bias.|Respondents from territories were excluded from sampling weights due to sparsity of data. Limited demographic matching between survey waves may lead to respondent misclassification.|Sampling limited to specific geographic regions; captive bats were native to insects as prey, possibly affecting behaviorâ€‹.|
