| Sample type               |The GSS GVP employs a stratified random sampling method, ensuring representation across various demographic groups within the Canadian population.|                                             |                                                                                             |
| Sample size                                           |The survey utilized a field sample of approximately 50,000 units. Of these, 40,000 households were invited to participate via an electronic questionnaire, and 24,000 completed questionnaires were expected. The sample sizes at the provincial and stratum levels were determined to ensure acceptable sampling variability for specific estimates, balancing precision at both national and stratum levels.|                                             |                                                                                             |
