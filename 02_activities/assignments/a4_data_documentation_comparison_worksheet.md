| Sample type               |The GSS GVP employs a stratified random sampling method, ensuring representation across various demographic groups within the Canadian population.|Two-wave panel survey, with a rolling cross-section during the campaign period and a post-election recontact wave.|                                                                                             |
| Sample size                                           |The survey utilized a field sample of approximately 50,000 units. Of these, 40,000 households were invited to participate via an electronic questionnaire, and 24,000 completed questionnaires were expected. The sample sizes at the provincial and stratum levels were determined to ensure acceptable sampling variability for specific estimates, balancing precision at both national and stratum levels.|Campaign Period Survey: 37,822 respondents and Post-Election Survey: 10,340 respondents.|                                                                                             |
| Target population                                     |The survey targets individuals aged 15 and older residing in Canada's ten provinces, excluding full-time residents of institutions.|Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.|                                                                                             |
| Sampling frame                                        |The sampling frame combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. This approach aims to enhance coverage of households with telephone access.|Stratified by region, with targets balanced on gender and age within each region. Regions include Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies, and British Columbia.

| Survey mode(s)                                        |The survey was conducted using a mixed-mode approach, including electronic questionnaires (e-questionnaires) sent to 40,000 households and follow-up through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) for selected participants who did not respond electronically. This combination aimed to maximize response rates and coverage.|Online survey conducted via the Qualtrics platform.|                                                                                             |

Elsewhere, after cleaning the responses, documentation states that '33,905 Campaign Period Survey and 9544 Post-Election Survey responses remain'. This generally translates into the Post-Election Survey response rate being higher than 92.3% (although it is not reliable).|                                                                                             |
